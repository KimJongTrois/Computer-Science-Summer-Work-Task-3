There are a multitude of different ways facial recognition and object detection software could be used in gaming and entertaintment. One example that this software could be used for is in animation, especially in gaming. To create a better sense of emersion in a game or animated movie, facial recognition could be combined with motion capture. With the addition of some advanced technology, facial recognition could be used to create the initial animation for a characters face; combined with the power of motion capture, this would create a very human-like character. Although this wouldn't be the definitive method for animating a character's face, as animators would probably have to iron out some mistakes, it could be used to create a lot more believable characters. Despite this wouldn't save much time, it would create a new sense of immersion for players and viewers.

A disadvantage of object detection software is that it could be used for cheating in specific video games. If the computer can detect what other players look like, it can then act against them in an unfair way, allowing hackers to have more opportunities to spoil other people's fun.
