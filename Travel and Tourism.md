# Travel and Tourism
Within the travel and tourism industry, security is one of the most important factors. It stops criminal activity entering or leaving a country and thus reduces crime. In the modern age, with object detection systems and facial recognition software more can be done to help prevent crime in this industry. Facial recognition can detect people and log them onto a database, this way, staff have list of everyone who has been to, for example, an airport. With this information, certain attributes can be assigned to that person on the database, such as their history with the airport. Using this near-instantaneous facial recognition, the system can automatically detect if anyone has been involved in any criminal behaviour before on this _airline_. This system of detecting crime is much faster than using a staff member to run a background check on each person entering and leaving the _airport_, therefore using object detection and facial recognition systems can make security in the travel and tourism industry more efficient, saving _airp ots_ moretime whilst allowing them to check more people.
