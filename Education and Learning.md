# Education and Learning
One of the main advantages of teaching students about real-time object detection and facial recognition systems is that they will, of course, learn from it. Sharing this knowledge about classification systems will help a new generation of people to understand more about neural networks, artificial intelligence, and classification systems. With this knowledge they will be able to build more advanced classification systems and ultimately help the human race in many different fields such as, medicine, robotics, or even astronomy.

However, object detection systems can pose a security risk seeing as there are skilled enough hackers out there that have the power to take personal data and information from these systems. Although it is unlikely, and there would be no real reason to do so, _a hacker could theoretically steal personal information from the students in that class who have used the object detection system_. That is to say, it would be a bit strange if the system logged your personal data, and in that case this could pose a security risk - but I'm not sure what anyone would benefit from logging this data in the middle of lesson. A simple sollution to this problem would go something like this: try to stay away from people's personal data.
